        <h1 align="center">CRICKET</h1>
<p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.</p>
<div class="Firstpart">
    <h3>Rules</h3></div><div class="Secondpart">
    <p> 1)An 'over' is six balls meaning he bowls six times. Then another player becomes the bowler for the next over, and bowls from the other end, and so on. The same bowler cannot bowl two overs one after the other.<br>
    2)The batsman misses the ball and it hits the wicket: called bowled.<br>
3)The ball hits the batsman's body when it would have hit the wicket otherwise. Called LBW (leg before wicket). The way this rule is applied is complicated; this is just the general idea.<br>
4)A fielder catches the ball after the batsman hits it, and before it bounces or leaves the field: called caught.<br>
5)While the batsmen are running, a fielder can throw the ball at the wicket. If the batsmen cannot finish the run, and the ball hits the wicket, the batsman nearer to the wicket that is hit is out: this is called run out.<br></p>

    <h3>Formats</h3></div><div class="Secondpart">
    <p>1)Test matches are the top international matches played between countries. The countries permitted to play test matches are accredited by the ICC: the International Cricket Council. The ten countries are listed above, with 'West Indies' counting for this purpose as a country. Tests last for up to five days: it is the longest format of cricket.<br>
    2)ODIs are usually restricted to 50 overs batting for each side. The highest team score is England 444-3 against Pakistan in August 2016. The highest individual score is 264 off 173 balls by Rohit Sharma for India against Sri Lanka.<br>
    3)Twenty20 cricket has 20 overs for each side. The highest team score is 263/5 by Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) against Pune Warriors India (PWI) in the 2013 IPL season. The highest individual score is 175* off 66 balls in the same match by Chris Gayle for RCB in the same match.</p>
