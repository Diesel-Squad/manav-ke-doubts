        Chess is believed to have originated in northwest India, in the Gupta Empire (c. 280–550) where its early form in the 6th century was known as chaturaṅga (Sanskrit: चतुरङ्ग), literally four divisions [of the military] – infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariotry, represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively. Then it spread eastward and westward along the Silk Road.

                        <ul>
                            <li> King can move exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. At most once in every game, each king is allowed to make a special move, known as castling.</li>
                            <li> Queen can move any number of vacant squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.</li>
                            <li> Rook can move any number of vacant squares vertically or horizontally. It also is moved while castling.</li>
                            <li> Bishop can move any number of vacant squares in any diagonal direction.</li>
                            <li> Knight can move one square along any rank or file and then at an angle. The knight´s movement can also be viewed as an “L” or “7″ laid out at any horizontal or vertical angle.</li>
                            <li> Pawns can move forward one square, if that square is unoccupied. If it has not yet moved, the pawn has the option of moving two squares forward provided both squares in front of the pawn are unoccupied. A pawn cannot move backward. Pawns are the only pieces that capture differently from how they move. They can capture an enemy piece on either of the two spaces adjacent to the space in front of them (i.e., the two squares diagonally in front of them) but cannot move to these spaces if they are vacant. The pawn is also involved in the two special moves en passant and promotion.</li>
                            <li><h3>Castling</h3>During the castling, the king moves two squares towards the rook he intends to castle with, and the rook moves to the square through which the king passed.
                            Castling is only permissible if all of the following conditions hold:
                            Neither king nor rook involved in castling may have moved from the original position;
                            There must be no pieces between the king and the rook;
                            The king may not currently be in check, nor may the king pass through or end up in a square that is under attack by an enemy piece (though the rook is permitted to be under attack and to pass over an attacked square)</li>
